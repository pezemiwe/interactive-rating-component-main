## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt how to display two pages using just one html and javscript file.

### Continued development

I hope to continue developing myself in frontend technology tools especially javascript and its frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8211128/multiple-distinct-pages-in-one-html-file) - This helped me to accomplish the two pager using one html, css and javascript file.
